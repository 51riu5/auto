# ü§ñ AI Integration Setup Guide

The Auto-Rickshaw Negotiation Simulator now features **AI-powered dynamic conversations**! Instead of pre-defined button responses, you can type naturally and get intelligent, contextual responses from the auto drivers.

## üöÄ Quick Start Options

### Option 1: OpenAI (Recommended) üéØ
**Best experience with GPT-3.5/GPT-4**

1. Get an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. When you first run the app, enter your API key in the configuration modal
3. Enjoy natural, dynamic conversations!

**Cost**: ~$0.002 per conversation (very affordable)

### Option 2: Local AI (Ollama) üè†
**Free and private - runs on your computer**

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/)
2. Download a model: `ollama pull llama2`
3. Start Ollama: `ollama serve`
4. Select "Local Ollama" in the app configuration

**Requirements**: 8GB+ RAM, modern CPU

### Option 3: Fallback Mode üîÑ
**Works without any setup - uses pre-written responses**

1. Select "Fallback Mode" in the configuration
2. Still fun and educational, just less dynamic
3. No API keys or installation needed

## üéÆ How the AI Experience Works

### Dynamic Conversations
- **Type naturally**: "Uncle, can you reduce the price a bit?"
- **Cultural awareness**: AI recognizes Malayalam phrases and cultural references
- **Personality-driven**: Each location has unique driver personalities
- **Contextual**: Responses change based on your negotiation history

### Smart Analysis
The AI analyzes your input for:
- **Politeness level**: "Please" vs "I demand"
- **Cultural sensitivity**: Using "Uncle", "Chettan", Malayalam phrases
- **Negotiation strategy**: Walking away, being practical, leveraging connections
- **Sentiment**: Positive, neutral, or negative tone

### Realistic Pricing
- Prices adjust based on your negotiation skills
- Better cultural awareness = better deals
- Driver mood affects their willingness to negotiate
- Each location has realistic pricing constraints

## üéØ Pro Tips for Best AI Experience

### With OpenAI:
```
‚úÖ "Chettan, petrol price is high, but ‚Çπ200 seems too much for this distance"
‚úÖ "Uncle, I'm a local person. Can you give me a fair rate?"
‚úÖ "I understand you need to make money, but what about ‚Çπ150?"
```

### Cultural Phrases That Work:
- **"Uncle"** / **"Chettan"** - Respectful address
- **"Setta, konjam kurayikamo?"** - "Brother, can you reduce?"
- **"Namaskaram"** - Formal greeting
- **"Fair price parayamo?"** - "Can you tell fair price?"

### Negotiation Strategies:
1. **Start polite**: Build rapport first
2. **Show local knowledge**: Mention you know the area
3. **Be reasonable**: Don't lowball immediately  
4. **Use cultural connection**: "My family lives here"
5. **Walk away threat**: Use sparingly but effectively
